            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            
            <p>When Alison met her classmate at the library, instead of showing grief and mourning for her father’s passing, she instead brushed it off and made a joke to change the topic.
               <br><br> The environment in which Alison grew up, it was weird to show affection to one another hence this rather comedic approach to process her feelings to her fathers passing instead of letting out grief and affection towards it.
                <br><br>She still cared about her father.
                Though there was this distance in between Alison and her father growing up, it was still apparent that he played a big part in her life.
                She remembers the times her father would bathe her even if her mother was the one that bathed her more often.
                
            </p>
            <br><br>
            
            <p>
                When Alison could not understand why her uncle canceled his annual fireworks show when he told Alison that it was out of respect for her father’s passing.
                <br><br>When her uncle told her that he was canceling the display out of respect for her dad, Alison responded “why?” with a puzzled look on her face. In a speech bubble, Alison shares that she had been hoping for a more blunt response. This could point to how the phenomenon of death is processed by the family, especially since they work so close to it.
                Working at the Fun Home in a way desensitized Alison from death.
