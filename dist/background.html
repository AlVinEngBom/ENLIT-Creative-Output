            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            
            <p>Alison Bechdel’s “Fun Home” was her own way of grieving and processing the emotions she had about her father’s passing. She was taught by her parents that art is one of the most important things that she must hold true to herself.
                <ul>
                    <li>Her father’s hobby of redesigning houses and rebuilding old furniture</li>
                    <li>Her mother’s career in music and amateur dramatics</li>
                    <li>Alison’s comic “Fun Home”</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <p>“Fun Home” Alison’s way of piecing together the reasoning behind how her father died<br>Alison’s father died due to a car accident that she theorized to be his father’s attempt at ending his own life
                <ul>
                    <li>Her father was found dead just months after she confessed to her parents that she was lesbian</li>
                    <li>“My perspective on that story has changed,” she says. “I’ve got so much more information now about my family and what happened. I’ve got more pieces of the puzzle.”</li>

                “Fun Home” based itself around this juxtaposition of an old nickname of a funeral home that Alison and her brother nicknamed “fun home”. Their father worked a part-time job in this funeral home as a funeral director.
                The name “Fun Home” being put beside a rather solemn and sad place, that being a funeral home, can be how Alison envisioned and drew inspiration from for her tragicomic “Fun Home”.

            <p>
                “Fun Home” centers on Alison Bechdel’s difficult relationship with her father. <br> This difficult relationship ultimately led to Alison’s confusing grief process, treating her father’s tragic death as if it was a comedy. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Her father’s obsession with the house and the abuse that came of it.</li>
                    <li>Her rare occurrence of physical contact with her father was because he was not very affectionate.</li>
                    <li>Alison’s dislike of her father’s “sissyness” led to her adapting to more masculine behaviors.</li>
                </ul>
