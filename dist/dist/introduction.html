            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The story starts off with Alison reminiscing her early childhood experiences with her father, then it continues with her expressing why she sees him in such a negative light. 

                Throughout the tragicomic, it can be inferred that Alison's lack of sympathy toward their father's passing was due to the absence of a warm parent-child relationship throughout their childhood. Alison views their father as an unreasonable person, and an unconventional father.

            <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
            
            <p>
                Alison treats their father's death not only as a life-changing tragedy but also as a comedy. Alison takes on a more casual attitude towards death, indicating that the social development of their family was rather unorthodox.
